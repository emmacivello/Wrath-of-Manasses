Software: The program was written in Java, using the development environment replit.com. The code was also tested using Visual Studio Code on Mac OS.

Summary: Wrath of Manasses is a fantasy choose-your-own-adventure game. The player has the option of choosing either a male or a female protagonist, 
and is tasked with saving the kingdom of Adalos from an evil being called Manasses who has recently escaped his banishment. The choices the protagonist 
makes and the people they decide to ally with determines the outcome of the game. There are numerous ways to lose as well as a path to a “bad win” in 
which the player stops Manasses but destroys the world’s magic in doing so. There is one “good win” in which the player stops Manasses without collateral damage.
	
Here are the important characters the player will meet. The program will display images of each.

Ruthard, a professor at the University of Meyerstern with possibly dubious motives

Vertaine, an assistant to Ruthard and a potential ally

Mihail, a kind Soothsayer who has possession of a mysterious book

Denise, a scribe for Mihail

Akhal, a stablehand and potential ally

Manasses, an evil being, banished for his ambitions which involved overtaking neighboring countries

Turin, a being of legend who once fought side-by-side with Manasses before recognizing the man’s evil heart and banishing him

Karalius, the king of Adalos

Mercurion, an alchemist and the player’s teacher, incapacitated early in the story
	
Denise, the scribe, records the player’s choices in a separate file called denisetext.txt. The player can print this file out on paper and thus receive 
a keepsake from the game.
